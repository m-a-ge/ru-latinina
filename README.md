## A Problem the project is meant to solve

As a user I want to be able to read updates from ru-latinina.livejournal.com LiveJournal community on social networks (vk.com, facebook.com, twitter.com)
Whenever a new post is published in LiveJournal community it should be posted into social networks using pre-configured accounts

## To Do

* find out if livejournal.com has an API for that task
* consult vk.com API docs to see how to post content on their social network
